## Lyrics

```
still i reach into the darkness
where all others seem to be
until bad just fucking happens
people keep away from glee

i admit i have been honest
for the sake of my own deed
so i'll turn the way too hasty 
pay ghost fees and promptly leave

all they see in me is gallows
while I wanna tell them live but 
they don't know what makes them anxious
kept forgiving all their sins

they don't care, it's damage done
they make you feel like shit
round and round and round it goes
hit and miss

i can't forgive all their sins
so they can forgive all their sins
vanish
panic / like crutches

```
